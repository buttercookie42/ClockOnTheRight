# Clock on the Right
An Xposed module to move the status bar clock back to the right side of the screen.
Based on the code by https://github.com/siavash79/PixelXpert.

## Compatibility
Requires at least Android 9, because that's when the clock moved to the left.
Currently only tested on Android 14, though it should probably work on earlier versions, too.
